# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Add Figma-style page management in the Pages panel with a context menu for
  renaming/deleting pages and drag-and-drop page reordering.

### Fixes

- Fix Figma clipboard fidelity: auto-layout frames with equal padding on
  all four sides now emit a single `stackPadding` aggregate instead of the
  redundant four-value padding fields, matching Figma's expected schema.
- Fix text `maxLines` and `textTruncation` not preserved on Figma clipboard
  copy — both fields are now serialized on the text NodeChange so truncated
  single/multi-line text round-trips into Figma intact.
- Fix font `fontDigest` always undefined on Figma clipboard copy. The digest
  map was keyed by raw family name while the serializer looked up by the
  normalized family name, so Figma could never match the font and always
  fell back to a default. The digest map now uses the normalized family as
  the key, tries the normalized and raw variants in the font cache, and
  triggers a load on demand so fonts referenced before first render also
  resolve.
- Fix CJK/Arabic text rendering as tofu on the first frame after opening
  a `.fig` file. The renderer no longer falls back to `r.textFont` (Inter)
  when `fontsLoaded` is false, the render loop now waits for `fontsLoaded`
  (with a 5s timeout escape hatch), `openFigFile` and `openFileInNewTab`
  call `ensureGraphFonts` to preload the document's text fonts and clear
  stale `textPicture` snapshots, and the CJK/Arabic fallback callback
  always fires so the canvas is re-painted even when the fallback never
  loaded (in which case a soft placeholder rectangle is shown instead of
  tofu).
- Match Figma auto-layout reflow when deleting children or hiding optional
  instance slots, including HUG-height component instances.
- Fix desktop clipboard copy/cut/paste by using Tauri's system clipboard
  bridge when browser clipboard events are unavailable.

## 0.13.3 — 2026-06-15

### Added

- Persist AI chat sessions per document to IndexedDB. Conversations survive
  closing and reopening a `.fig`/`.pen` file, and switching between documents
  restores each doc's own session history. Each doc supports multiple
  named sessions with rename, delete, and switch.
- Add a `ChatExportMenu` to the AI chat toolbar — copy the current session
  as plain text or Markdown, or download it as a `.md` file.
- Expose `EditorStore.getFilePath` so the chat persistence layer can derive
  a stable `docKey` per document.
- Add JSX authoring support for components, component sets, and instances.
- Add design JSX variable helpers so color props can use `designVar()` / `defineVars()` references and emit graph variable bindings.
- Add structured design JSX paint helpers for solid fills, multiple fills, and gradients.
- Add structured design JSX effect helpers for shadows and blur effects.
- Add the `@open-pencil/dom-css` package skeleton for DOM/CSS projection and browser/headless CSS runtime adapters.
- Add initial `@open-pencil/dom-css` DesignDOM SceneGraph conversion helpers for HTML/CSS-shaped card layouts.
- Add `parse5`-backed headless HTML parsing for `@open-pencil/dom-css` DesignDOM documents.
- Add CSSOM-backed headless style computation for basic `tag`, `.class`, `#id`, descendant, and child selectors with shorthand expansion.
- Add an HTML/CSS card round-trip fixture covering DesignDOM style computation, SceneGraph import, and HTML serialization.
- Add `compileTailwindCSS()` to delegate utility compilation to Tailwind v4 and cover generated CSS ingestion through CSSOM and SceneGraph conversion.
- Add browser-oracle DOM/CSS fixtures for Tailwind cards/buttons, CSS custom properties, `calc()`, and modern computed color output.
- Add high-level `htmlToDesignDocument()`, `htmlToSceneGraph()`, `tailwindHTMLToDesignDocument()`, and `tailwindHTMLToSceneGraph()` helpers.
- Improve `@open-pencil/dom-css` conversion for flex alignment, independent corner radii, per-side stroke weights, clipping, and size constraints.
- Expand DOM/CSS fixture coverage for inputs, badges, nav rows, dialogs, and Tailwind-generated utility styles.
- Add package-local `@open-pencil/dom-css` tests so the package can be validated independently with `bun run test` from `packages/dom-css`.
- Add standalone `@open-pencil/dom-css` typecheck, check, and built-package smoke scripts for external package maintenance.
- Improve `@open-pencil/dom-css` SceneGraph to CSS export parity for logical padding, independent border sides, opacity, text typography, and shadows.
- Add `@open-pencil/dom-css` JSX runtime helpers for DOM-shaped authoring into DesignDOM, CSS runtime styling, SceneGraph conversion, and Tailwind-generated CSS flows.
- Add browser-first JSX/Tailwind helpers for native `getComputedStyle()` conversion, expand CSS mapping for flex wrapping, self alignment, absolute positioning basics, and document the future `@open-pencil/kiwi` / `@open-pencil/fig` package split plan.
- Add a CLI `dom` command for converting HTML/CSS/Tailwind input into editable `.fig` documents through `@open-pencil/dom-css`.
- Add type-validated `bindVariable`/`unbindVariable` with event emission and indexed binding format (`fills/N/color` instead of `fills[N]`).
- Add `unbind_variable` MCP tool for removing variable bindings.
- Add `openpencil analyze overlaps`, the `analyze_overlaps` RPC command, and the `analyze_overlaps` ToolDef for heuristic overlap detection. The command reports sibling overlaps, children overflowing non-clipping parents, and overlay/backdrop patterns, with filters for page/page ID, scope, category, severity, min area/ratio, node type, hidden/locked/absolute nodes, result limit, and `--json` output.
- Add overlap analysis exports for automation consumers, including `computeOverlaps`, `analyzeOverlaps`, overlap result types, and parameter parsers from core subpath exports.
- Add world-matrix visual bounds to overlap analysis, covering vector/stroke/text geometry, ancestor clipping, rotated clipping frames, and nested ancestor rotations.
- Add the `@open-pencil/core/package.json` subpath export for package metadata consumers.

### Fixes

- Fix `LayerTree.vue` rename input not focusing when the row is inside the
  flattened `v-for`. Vue collected the `ref="renameInput"` as an array,
  making `.focus` undefined; switched to a function ref that handles both
  single-element and array bindings.
- Allow chat e2e tests to find the AI tab by both English ("AI") and
  Chinese ("AI") labels, and grant clipboard permissions for the
  copy-as-text / copy-as-Markdown exports.
- Fix clone operations (duplicate, instance creation, clipboard copy) sharing
  mutable references with the original — editing fills, strokes, variable
  bindings, overrides, or vector networks on one no longer corrupts the other.
- Fix instance overrides shallow-copied on clone — override values containing
  objects are now deep-copied.
- Fix stale variable bindings not cleaned up when fills/strokes arrays shrink —
  any indexed sub-path is now handled, not just `/color`.
- Fix tooltips around inspector dropdowns/popovers without breaking floating
  menu anchoring.
- Fix CJK canvas text rendering by bundling an offline Noto Sans SC fallback
  font for CanvasKit.
- Harden MCP calls with bounded page-tree responses, oversized-result errors,
  JSON HTTP responses, and stale WebSocket cleanup.
- Improve Figma boolean imports by preserving XOR operations as editable
  exclude nodes and falling back to imported fill geometry when boolean path
  reconstruction cannot produce a path.
- Preserve rotated Figma transform origins for imported vector nodes.
- Render complex text fills through vector glyph outlines so imported Figma
  text can use the normal fill pipeline for gradients, images, patterns, and
  other non-solid paints.
- Fix tofu glyphs in cold-start Tauri 2 desktop builds. Wait for
  `fontManager.ensureFallbackPack()` before declaring fonts loaded in
  `loadFonts`, and retry `fetchBundledFont` up to three times with
  exponential backoff so a cold-start Tauri protocol race doesn't lose
  the first font fetch.
- Roll back the experimental `assetProtocol` scope / `bundle.resources`
  font work and the `convertFileSrc` URL rewrite. Combined with
  `tauri-plugin-updater` the `**` asset scope may have been redirecting
  WebView2's fetch stack; the above retry alone is sufficient to clear
  the tofu on cold start without it, and the rollback restores outbound
  HTTPS to the AI provider.
- Fix the built-in `minimax` (MiniMax) preset for the `minimaxi.com` entrypoint
  by using `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1` instead of the previous
  `https://api.minimax.io/v1` base URL.
- Reload AI chat sessions on first open of a file. The tab id doesn't
  change when a file is opened in the active tab, so the previous
  `watch(activeTab.id)` never fired and `ensureChat` ran with whatever
  `filePath` happened to be at app launch (often `dn:Untitled` or
  `tab:tab-1`), so messages were saved under the wrong key and only
  loaded after a tab switch forced a re-key. Add a second watch on
  the active editor's `filePath + documentName` so the sessions store
  re-resolves the docKey as soon as the source becomes available.
- Add AI provider connection testing with clearer setup errors for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Increase per-test timeout for slow `gold-preview.fig` fixture tests (`clipboard roundtrip`, `group reclassification`, `glyph blob preservation`, `auto-layout text measurement`, and `render/canvas/cache`) so they no longer flake on slower CI runners.
- Fix desktop "Share This File" links to use the public `https://app.openpencil.dev/share/{roomId}` URL instead of the internal `tauri://localhost` app scheme.
- Fix file-backed CLI commands (`convert`, `eval --output`, `export`) to use Node `fs/promises` instead of Bun runtime APIs, so the published CLI works when installed and run under Node.
- Fix `analyze_overlaps` stroke-overflow bounds for rotated nodes by expanding the local rectangle before transforming through the world matrix, so stroked rotated nodes are measured with their true rotated footprint.
- Fix `analyze_overlaps` clipping across multiple rotated ancestors by preserving the clipped polygon through the full clip chain instead of collapsing to an AABB between clips, which could reintroduce corners removed by an inner clip.
- Fix `analyze_overlaps` `limit` of `0` (or a negative value) so it caps the returned overlaps to an empty list instead of returning the full set; summary totals still reflect the complete result.
- Trim whitespace from `analyze_overlaps` `scope` and `severity` inputs so values like `" major "` resolve instead of falling back to defaults.
- Export `OverlapScope`, `AnalyzeOverlapsSummary`, and `OverlapIntersection` from the `@open-pencil/core/tools/analyze` barrel so consumers do not need to deep-import the overlaps module.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Update the Homebrew install command to use the published `openpencil` cask.

### Fixes

- Fix the published MCP package so global installs include the `openpencil-mcp` and `openpencil-mcp-http` launchers required by desktop app integrations.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-05-29

### Fixes

- Fix the npm package contents for the CLI so Bun installs include the built `openpencil` binary and runtime bundle.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-29

### Fixes

- Fix the published CLI package so Bun global installs run the built `openpencil` binary instead of raw TypeScript sources.

- Greatly improve importing Figma `.fig` files with complex component systems: badges, avatars, icons, links, input fields, lists, date pickers, nested instances, component swaps, and variant properties now open much closer to their original Figma appearance.
- Fix missing or white content in imported `.fig` files caused by unresolved Figma variable bindings, including image/avatar badges, icon colors, text colors, and variable-backed component overrides.
- Preserve more Figma document details when opening and saving `.fig` files, including internal component pages, component ordering, page metadata, canvas backgrounds, text layout, glyph rendering, vector geometry, effects, shadows, and instance overrides.
- Keep user edits after opening an imported `.fig` file: changing size, position, fills, text, or layout now wins over preserved Figma round-trip data when the document is saved again.
- Fix `.fig` exports so files reopened in Figma or OpenPencil keep their pages, components, instances, text wrapping, icons, avatars, and preview thumbnail intact.
- Fix live canvas updates during move/resize/edit previews so visible scene changes repaint immediately.
- Fix accidental duplicate creation when Alt-clicking without dragging.
- Fix MCP startup in the browser.
- Fix CanvasKit loading outside the browser when project paths contain spaces.
- Render imported Figma layer and fill blend modes such as multiply, screen, overlay, difference, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity.
- Render common imported Figma mask stacks so visible layers above alpha, vector, or luminance masks are clipped by the mask shape, including consecutive mask layers.
- Render Figma-style smoothed rectangle corners, including independent corner radii, and effect blend modes from imported Figma files.
- Improve imported tiled image fills by applying Figma image transforms when repeating image patterns.
- Keep imported Figma boolean operations editable as boolean-operation nodes instead of flattening them to vectors.
- Apply imported variable font axes from Figma `fontVariations` when rendering text.
- Render more imported Figma visual metadata, including text decoration styles, leading trim, pattern fills, layout grids, page guides, and deterministic fallbacks for raw noise effects.

### Performance

- Open large `.fig` files faster by deferring work for pages you have not viewed yet while still preparing all needed content before export.
- Improve canvas responsiveness during zooming, panning, dragging, and editing by reusing cached scene backing where safe.
- Speed up `.fig` export for documents with many preserved Figma paint and variable payloads.

## 0.12.2 — 2026-05-19

### Added

- Allow OpenRouter users to enter any model ID from provider settings with cached autocomplete suggestions for tool-capable models, while keeping the curated dropdown as the default when no custom model is set.

### Changed

- Use localized app tooltips instead of native browser titles across editor controls, panels, and menus.
- Update Claude Code MCP setup documentation and the docs landing screenshot.
- Ignore non-source Markdown files in the app dev watcher so documentation edits do not reload the running editor.

### Fixes

- Route Claude Code stdio MCP requests through the live OpenPencil app connection, including immediate disconnected errors when no document is connected.
- Keep MCP disconnected guidance focused on starting OpenPencil and opening a document.
- Improve agent-rendered JSX compatibility with Figma-style text, alignment, and rotation aliases; strip HTML comments; and report unsupported props from render tools.
- Load exact text font styles after MCP and AI tool mutations so newly created bold/weighted text renders immediately.
- Include text style fields in MCP `get_node` output so agents can verify generated text accurately.
- Keep provider settings tooltip/popover composition working in WebKit.

## 0.12.1 — 2026-05-19

### Fixes

- Fix `.fig` round-trips for OpenPencil component sets and variable bindings, and recompute imported layouts after opening documents.
- Report desktop/MCP package version mismatches explicitly and include package-manager-aware install guidance from the MCP server.
- Support scoped MCP `save_file({ path })` workflows while keeping file saving in the desktop app.
- Use native Tauri path handling for save parent directories so Unicode and Windows paths are handled correctly.
- Fix the web font picker so Google Fonts remain available in Safari, local font access is requested on first open when supported, font sources are labeled, and Google font previews load lazily for visible rows.
- Fix background blur rendering so it blurs the backdrop behind a layer instead of applying a no-op content filter, and keep effect parameter controls visible in the properties panel.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-05-18

### Added

- Assets panel — browse, search, and insert document components directly from the left sidebar.
- Component variants — switch instance variants from the right inspector; default variant respects property definitions.
- Figma library metadata — component keys, source libraries, version IDs, descriptions, and docs links are preserved on import/export.
- Desktop file associations — double-click `.fig` or `.pen` files in Finder/Explorer to open them in OpenPencil.
- Auto-update — startup update checks and a Check for Updates menu item on desktop.
- Light theme with theme-aware canvas rulers.
- PDF export — available in the export panel, CLI (`--format pdf`), and MCP.
- SVG import tool for automation workflows.
- DeepSeek AI provider.
- Variable modes — create, rename, duplicate, delete, and set defaults per collection.
- Variable binding controls for fills, strokes, sizing, min/max, and typography fields.
- Auto-layout inspector controls for min/max dimensions, auto gap, wrap gap, and two-axis padding.
- Stroke dash/gap controls.
- Font settings — local font access, fallback predownloads, and downloaded font cache management.
- Editor commands for frame selection, paste to replace, Boolean operations, flatten, outline text, and outline stroke.
- Boolean operations panel control and canvas context-menu entries for flattening and outlining supported selections.

### Changed

- Smaller domain modules across core, app, Vue SDK, CLI, MCP, docs, and desktop with enforced package boundaries.
- Separate scene and overlay canvas layers — rulers, labels, and selections no longer cause scene redraws.
- Shared menu schema between browser and native Tauri menus.
- Editor command metadata now drives shortcut display across browser menus, native menus, tooltips, and context menus.
- Text-to-vector conversion now uses shared loaded-font outline geometry across Boolean, flatten, and outline commands.

### Fixes

- Fix `.fig` export of component variant properties and text stretch alignment so designs round-trip correctly through Figma.
- Fix CJK and Arabic text rendering — fallback fonts now load before the first paint instead of showing blank text.
- Fix large `.fig` files freezing on open — parsing runs in a worker, and the viewport fits to content after loading.
- Improve Figma import fidelity — variable aliases, nested instances, avatar swaps, badge internals, and input text alignment are preserved.
- Improve Figma export fidelity — flipped vectors, stroke geometry, visual overflow, and stroked-shape drop shadows are preserved.
- Fix variant switching so instances update their contents, not just the component reference.
- Fix text editing inside components and instances on double-click.
- Fix paste into selected containers and entered frames.
- Fix clipboard parsing to safely ignore invalid data.

- Fix canvas size badges scaling with zoom.
- Fix layout inspector dropdown anchoring and spacing/padding icon clarity.
- Fix section drawing and color input forwarding in the property panel.
- Fix asset insertion coordinates inside entered containers.
- Fix MCP stdio handshake and eval return values.
- Fix `@open-pencil/vue` npm imports referencing an unexported core subpath.
- Fix Figma clipboard text compatibility — pasted OpenPencil text keeps editable fixed bounds, line wrapping, baselines, glyph offsets, and Figma edit-mode layout.
- Fix local font matching so requested upright and weighted faces do not fall back to italic or regular faces.
- Fix CanvasKit paragraph rendering to preserve requested text weights and slants.
- Fix nested text editing interactions — drill double-click enters nested text edit mode, and clicking another text node switches edit targets while editing.
- Fix auto-height text edit commits so text bounds and undo state stay in sync.
- Fix Boolean, flatten, and outline operations to reject unsupported image/complex-script sources safely instead of silently dropping geometry.
- Fix outline stroke enablement for stroked descendants inside groups and containers.

### Performance

- Event-driven canvas rendering — scene and overlay layers only repaint when their inputs change, replacing continuous polling.
- Shared RAF scheduler coalesces scene and overlay frames into a single animation frame per editor.
- Font-family fallback arrays and downloaded remote fonts are cached to avoid repeated work.
- WebGL draw-call instrumentation only runs while the profiler is active.
- Instance override resolution is cached and `.fig` pages load lazily for large files.
- Live drag/resize uses repaint-only previews to skip layout during interaction.

- Add `open_file` and `new_document` MCP tools with `OPENPENCIL_MCP_ROOT` path scoping
- Optional `path` param on `export_image`, `export_svg`, `get_jsx` — write output to disk instead of returning base64/string
- Multi-root JSX support — multiple top-level elements auto-wrapped in a fragment
- `Component` and `Instance` tag aliases in JSX renderer
- JSX prop reference doc — copy to clipboard via book icon in Code panel
- Prompts (`CODEGEN_PROMPT`, `JSX_REFERENCE`) moved from embedded strings to markdown files

### Fixes

- Fix Backspace not deleting selected nodes after clicking on canvas — canvas now receives focus on click so keyboard shortcuts aren't blocked by stale input focus
- Support Cmd/Ctrl+click for additive multi-select in layers panel (previously only Shift+click worked)
- Fix macOS Tauri build — move `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` ATS config from invalid `tauri.conf.json` property to a proper `Info.plist` file
- Fix tab order and keyboard handling in inspector panel

- Fix `openpencil-mcp` npm package missing `dist/stdio.js` — explicitly list entry points in tsconfig
- Show toast when MCP server fails to start instead of silently swallowing the error
- Fix provider settings popover not appearing — tooltip wrapper broke floating-ui positioning

- Add `save_file` MCP tool for saving the current document to disk
- Clipboard text export now writes richer v4 `derivedTextData` payloads with glyph outlines for better paste fidelity

## 0.11.3 — 2026-04-08

- Unify the size control into a single inline sizing input/dropdown with shorter localized labels to prevent overflow

## 0.11.2 — 2026-03-30

### Fixes

- Stabilize npm publishing with isolated temp publish directories instead of mutating tracked package manifests in CI

- Fix `@open-pencil/mcp` release packaging so the published npm tarball includes its built `dist/` CLI and server entrypoints deterministically
- Fix `@open-pencil/core` release build configuration so CI publish jobs include Node and Bun ambient types when compiling package artifacts

## 0.11.1 — 2026-03-30

### Fixes

- Fix npm publishing pipeline to publish packed tarballs instead of raw package folders
- Attempt to fix `@open-pencil/mcp` npm package contents so the published CLI includes its built `dist/` entrypoints
- Fix `@open-pencil/vue` npm package metadata and build output so the published package resolves from `dist/` while local workspace development keeps using source aliases

## 0.11.0 — 2026-03-30

### Features

- Lock and visibility toggle buttons in layers panel (hover to reveal, always shown when active)
- Figma-style selection scope — double-click to enter groups/frames/components, Escape to exit
- Nested container navigation — each double-click goes one level deeper
- Dashed border around entered container for visual feedback
- Layer panel click syncs canvas scope automatically
- Vue SDK internationalization primitives — `useI18n()`, locale detection, persisted locale selection, lazy-loaded locale JSON files, and exported locale metadata for custom editor shells
- Vue SDK docs and public API audit — documented advanced exports (`useOkHCL()`, variables helpers, viewport and locale APIs), aligned docs with the actual `provideEditor()` injection model, and expanded release-ready SDK guidance
- npm release pipeline now publishes `@open-pencil/core`, `@open-pencil/cli`, `@open-pencil/mcp`, and `@open-pencil/vue` together on version tags
- App language picker in the menu bar — switch UI locale without reloading
- Added a vector curve editor and improved drawing experience with the pen tool
- Resume pen drawing from existing open path endpoints — click an endpoint to continue the curve
- Close open paths by dragging one endpoint to the other
- Align selected anchor points relative to each other in vector edit mode — the standard alignment buttons in the position panel now operate on selected vertices when 2 or more are selected
- Unified core IO format registry — `.fig` is now modeled as the native document format alongside shared export adapters for PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG, and JSX
- Export selection or current page as `.fig` from the app export UI and app menu
- New CLI commands: `open-pencil convert` for document conversion, `open-pencil formats` to inspect readable/writable/exportable formats, and `open-pencil lint` for design consistency, structure, and accessibility checks
- CLI export now supports `.fig` output and routes PNG/JPG/WEBP/SVG/JSX/`.fig` through the shared IO layer
- `Open…` now supports `.pen` Pencil documents through the shared document reader pipeline while keeping `.fig` as the native save format
- Display‑P3 document color space pipeline — documents now default to Display‑P3, `.fig` import/export preserves document color profiles, the live canvas requests P3 surfaces with sRGB fallback, and raster/SVG export paths accept explicit color-space targets
- Color picker overhaul — unified `RGB` / `HSL` / `HSB` / `OkHCL` field formats, slider-space-aware track/thumb previews, and better neutral-color editing behavior for fills, strokes, gradient stops, and component fills
- OkHCL metadata now round-trips through `.fig` plugin data and integrates directly into the main fill/stroke color workflow with preview gamut diagnostics
- Vue SDK now exposes reusable color-picker model helpers and solid fill/stroke commit helpers for custom editor shells
- Update built-in Z.ai and MiniMax model lists — Z.ai now uses the Anthropic-compatible endpoint for GLM coding models, adds GLM-5.1, and MiniMax adds M2.7 / M2.7-highspeed
- Arabic and RTL support across text rendering, editing, layout, export, and AI tooling — text nodes support `Auto`/`LTR`/`RTL`, auto-layout frames support `Auto`/`LTR`/`RTL` flow, and JSX/AI prompts/tools can now generate and edit both explicitly

### Fixes

- Fix shortcuts, now work on non-English keyboard layouts.
- Fix imported `.fig` file open and page-switch regressions — loaded documents now keep graph/store state in sync, remap imported canvas/page children correctly, and recompute imported auto-layout descendants when switching pages
- Fix first canvas render happening before fonts load — wait for fonts before the initial draw to avoid Safari and text measurement glitches
- Preserve `fig-kiwi` version on `.fig` roundtrip — imports keep the original header version instead of rewriting everything to a hardcoded value; new files default to version 101
- Normalize auto-layout text export for Figma — text children inside auto-layout frames now serialize with `NONE` auto-resize to match Figma behavior and avoid overflow on reimport
- Fix keyboard editing regressions after the refactor — canvas shortcuts no longer fire while editing text, and Delete/Backspace no longer delete nodes during text entry
- Fix MCP page switching persistence — `switch_page` now survives across tool calls in the same session
- Improve CJK font fallback coverage — load multiple Google Fonts for broader Han/Japanese/Korean text support
- Normalize more visible UI strings for localized app chrome — menus, panels, variables dialog, code panel, chat setup, and editor controls now respect the selected locale instead of falling back to English in common flows
- Fix imported text rendering in browser and headless export — preserve stored bounds until fonts are ready, restore missing font-loaded guards, use natural width for `WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT` text, and clip text to node bounds
- Fix browser/headless rendering mismatch for imported toolbar/instance content by correcting runtime imported layout recomputation instead of diverging browser rendering behavior
- Fix `set_layout` tool not defaulting to HUG sizing when enabling auto-layout — frames now shrink/grow to fit children instead of keeping fixed dimensions
- Normalize font family names on `.fig` export — strip optical size suffixes (e.g. "DM Sans 9pt" → "DM Sans") so Figma recognizes the font
- TEXT nodes now default to a solid black fill — previously exported with no fill, making text invisible when opened in Figma
- Fix save crash when COLOR variable is missing alpha channel
- Fix console error spam on deployed web app from automation WebSocket reconnect loop
- Fix headless CLI font fallback — bundled Inter font now ships with `@open-pencil/core` and loads without a web server
- Locked nodes now block move, resize, rotate, and delete on canvas
- Locked containers block double-click enter
- Marquee selection skips locked and hidden nodes
- COMPONENT/INSTANCE containers are now enterable via double-click
- Replaced the alignment and reflection icons with the correct ones

## 0.10.0 — 2026-03-15

### Performance

- Offload .fig parsing (unzip + Kiwi decode) to a Web Worker — main thread stays responsive during file open
- Offload .fig compression to a Web Worker during save (was blocking 450ms+)
- Add instance index (`componentId → Set<nodeId>`) — `getInstances()` is O(1) instead of scanning all nodes
- Defer graph event subscription until after layout computation during file open — eliminates redundant `syncInstances` calls
- Cache label collection (sections/components) per scene mutation instead of walking the full tree every frame
- Blocking font loading — fonts load before first render to ensure correct glyphs

### Features

- ACP agent support — use Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI as AI assistants in the desktop chat panel
- Permission confirmation dialog — ACP agents request user approval for file/shell operations, MCP design tools auto-approved
- Unified MCP server — single HTTP + WebSocket proxy replaces Vite SSR bridge
- Stock photo integration — `stock_photo` tool fetches images from Pexels or Unsplash and applies to design nodes. Provider adapter supports custom providers.
- Skeleton-first AI workflow — 4-phase design process (plan → skeleton → content fill via `replace_id` → polish) for more reliable AI-generated layouts
- Batched AI tools — `calc` accepts arrays of expressions, `stock_photo` fetches all images in parallel, `batch_update` applies multiple property changes in one call, `describe` accepts `ids` array for multi-node inspection
- AI visual feedback — blue pulsing border on nodes being modified, green flash on completion
- Auto-depth `describe` — adapts inspection depth to subtree size (small block → deeper, large page → shallower)
- `set_fill` gradient support — linear gradients with `color_end` and `gradient` direction params
- `render` tool `replace_id` — atomically swap skeleton placeholders with real content
- MCP `export_image_file` tool for headless PNG rendering
- Grid layout in AI chat — JSX renderer supports `grid`, `columns`, `rows`, `gap` props
- Configurable max output tokens in AI provider settings (default 16384)
- Z.ai AI provider with GLM-5, GLM-4.7, GLM-4.6, GLM-4.5 model families

- Show warning toast when fonts fail to load, error toast when file open fails
- Fix FillPicker crash when selecting image fills (missing `ref` import from #92)
- Fix Google Fonts TLS/network errors not cached — failed families no longer retry on every render
- Fix CJK text garbled when font is unavailable — fallback now renders through paragraph shaper instead of raw `drawText`, preserving CJK characters via the fallback font chain

### Features

- XPath query command — `open-pencil query design.fig "//FRAME[@width < 300]"` to find nodes by type, attributes, and tree structure using XPath selectors
- CSS Grid layout mode — select a frame, click the grid icon in the auto layout toolbar to switch from flex to grid. Configure column/row tracks (fr, fixed px, auto), column and row gaps, and per-side padding. Powered by a [Yoga fork](https://github.com/open-pencil/yoga/tree/grid) with cherry-picked CSS Grid PRs from upstream
- JSX and Tailwind CSS export for grid layouts — `grid grid-cols-N`, `gap-x-*`/`gap-y-*`, child `col-start-*`/`row-start-*`/`col-span-*`/`row-span-*`
- Multi-provider AI support — connect to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint directly, in addition to OpenRouter. Per-provider API key storage, provider settings popover, automatic migration from single OpenRouter key
- Anthropic-compatible provider for custom API endpoints
- New AI tools: `get_jsx` (JSX roundtrip view), `diff_jsx` (structural diff), `describe` (semantic role, visual style, layout, design issues)
- AI visual verification — `export_image` returns image content to the model for vision-based review
- API type toggle (Completions/Responses) for OpenAI-compatible providers
- Figma zoom shortcuts — ⌘0 (100%), ⌘1 (zoom to fit), ⌘2 (zoom to selection), ⇧1/⇧2 alternatives
- XPath query tool — `query_nodes` for AI/MCP with attribute selectors, tree traversal, and type filtering

### Fixes

- Serialize variables, collections, and bindings to `.fig` files — previously lost on save (#65)
- Text nodes created via MCP now render in Figma — emit `derivedTextData` with font metadata and layout size (#64)
- Double-click on layer tree no longer toggles expand/collapse — use the chevron instead
- Page rename input matches layer rename styling
- Fix `w="fill"`/`h="fill"` in JSX renderer — now direction-aware based on parent flex axis
- Fix text auto-resize defaulting to fixed 100×100 — text without explicit width uses `WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT`
- Fix `clipsContent` not propagated to Yoga — frames with clip enabled now set `Overflow.Hidden`
- Fix `COUNTER_ALIGN_MAP` mapping stretch to `MIN` instead of `STRETCH`
- Fix JSX export omitting x/y for absolute-positioned children
- Fix JSX export ignoring `textAutoResize` for text sizing

- Fix orphaned instances on clipboard paste — detach to FRAME when component is missing
- Fix text typography lost on Figma clipboard import — preserve fontFamily, fontWeight, fontSize, lineHeight
- Fix `copyFill` missing `gradientTransform` and `imageTransform` — gradient fills now round-trip correctly

### Performance

- Event-driven rendering and component sync — `SceneGraph` emits typed events on mutations; `requestRender()` calls reduced from 94 to 22, component instance sync uses microtask batching with deduplication
- Replace `structuredClone` with typed copy helpers for fills, strokes, effects, and style runs (~24× faster in hot paths)
- Filter .fig unzip to only decompress canvas and image entries, skipping metadata cruft

### Improvements

- Padding on a frame auto-enables vertical auto-layout
- AI tools run `computeAllLayouts` after execution — layout updates immediately
- Enhanced AI system prompt with full JSX prop reference and verification workflow
- Chat panel preserves messages when toggling UI visibility
- SceneGraph event bus (nanoevents) — `node:created`, `node:updated`, `node:deleted`, `node:reparented`, `node:reordered` events replace monkey-patching in collab sync and manual render invalidation
- Replace esbuild-wasm (14 MB) with sucrase (201 KB) for JSX transform — `buildComponent()` and `renderJSX()` now synchronous and browser-compatible
- `useMagicKeys` keyboard shortcut system — replaces tinykeys with VueUse built-in, cross-platform Meta/Control handling, modifier exclusion for combo conflicts
- Dev-only debug toolbar for copying chat logs
- Auto-layout icons in layer tree — vertical (rows), horizontal (columns), and grid icons for auto-layout frames; components keep their purple diamond
- Frame titles on canvas are now draggable — clicking a selected top-level frame's name label starts a drag
- Compact layout controls — icon-based gap (↔/↕) and padding (T/R/B/L) inputs instead of text labels
- Auto-detect horizontal vs vertical direction when wrapping in auto layout (Shift+A)
- Fix alignment grid for vertical layouts — visual positions now match spatial axes
- Fix grid switch from HUG-sized frames — frame expands to fit children
- Remove unwanted white fill when wrapping in auto layout

## 0.8.0 — 2026-03-07

- Tailwind CSS v4 JSX export — export selections as HTML with Tailwind utility classes (`<div className="flex gap-4 p-3">`) from the Code panel, CLI (`bun open-pencil export --format jsx --style tailwind`), or programmatically via `sceneNodeToJSX(id, graph, 'tailwind')`. Supports layout, sizing, colors, border radius, opacity, rotation, overflow, shadows, blur, and typography. Uses v4 spacing semantics (px/4 multiplier) with automatic fallback to arbitrary values.
- Code panel format toggle — switch between OpenPencil (custom components) and Tailwind (HTML + utility classes) output
- Homebrew tap — `brew install open-pencil/tap/open-pencil` for macOS (arm64 + x64), auto-updated on each release

- VitePress docs site — user guide, reference, architecture, and development docs at openpencil.dev with 6 locales (en, de, fr, es, it, pl), SEO (OG tags, hreflang, JSON-LD, sitemap), and dark theme

### Improvements

- Refactor mobile drawer tabs, layout sizing dropdowns, and inline rename to use Reka UI primitives
- Add shared UI style helpers with tailwind-variants for menus, selects, buttons, and surfaces
- Unified tool definitions — define once in `packages/core/src/tools/`, automatically available in AI chat, CLI, and MCP

### Internal

- Add `motion-v` for declarative animations — used in mobile drawer (spring-animated height with pan gestures) and toolbar (layout-animated category switching with directional slide transitions)
- Mobile drawer: replace `useSwipe` + manual rAF animation with `motion.div` `:animate` + `@pan`/`@panEnd`; always-on tab state (no more null `activeRibbonTab`); content stays rendered when closed
- Mobile toolbar: replace manual `scrollWidth` measuring + inline CSS transitions with `motion.div layout` + `AnimatePresence` directional slide variants
- Mobile UI cleanup: extract shared `colorToCSS` util to core, `initials` to `src/utils/text`, `toolIcons` to `src/utils/tools`; replace hand-rolled dropdowns with reka-ui Popover/DropdownMenu; narrow `mobileDrawerSnap` type to string union; move magic numbers to constants; disable PWA service worker in dev mode
- 83 new E2E tests (57 → 140): design panel, code panel, components, copy/paste, multi-page, text editing, keyboard shortcuts, context menu

- Renderer profiler with in-canvas HUD overlay, GPU timing, and phase instrumentation

### Improvements

- Replace custom color picker with Reka UI Color components (ColorArea, ColorSlider, ColorField) — adds keyboard navigation and accessibility to the color area, hue, and alpha controls

### Fixes

- CJK text rendering — load a system CJK font (PingFang SC, Microsoft YaHei, Noto Sans CJK) as fallback; falls back to Noto Sans SC from Google Fonts when no system font is available (#48)
- Font registration errors no longer cache invalid font data — `loadFont` only caches after successful CanvasKit registration
- Fix `render` tool failing on Windows + Bun with "Cannot find module" error (#43)
- Fix hover highlighting nodes from internal component pages — scope hit-test to current page
- Fix hit-testing on transparent frames and groups — empty containers without fills or strokes are now click-through, clipping parents reject hits outside their bounds, matching Figma behavior
- Fix instance overrides on .fig import and clipboard paste — resolve guidPaths by overrideKey, handle component swaps (`overriddenSymbolID`), propagate through nested clone chains. Import and paste now share a single override engine.
- Apply Figma component property assignments on import — boolean visibility toggles and instance swaps via `componentPropRefs`/`componentPropAssignments`
- Apply `derivedSymbolData` sizes on import — containers now shrink correctly when component properties hide children
- Fix override resolution for nested instance targets — check the current node before searching descendants
- Fix component property assignments for nested instances — resolve scoped `componentPropAssignments` inside `symbolOverrides` via guidPath, handle `guidValue` for instance swaps, reorder phases so transitive sync doesn't clobber visibility
- Pixel-perfect vector rendering using pre-computed `fillGeometry`/`strokeGeometry` blobs from .fig files — eliminates white gaps between adjacent stroked shapes
- Stroke outlines on clipboard paste — convert vectorNetwork paths to filled outlines via CanvasKit when geometry blobs are unavailable
- Apply `derivedSymbolData` transforms and geometry during import — instance children render at correct scale and position
- Fix internal pages becoming visible after .fig round-trip — preserve `internalOnly` flag on export
- Scope layout recomputation to current page for paste/undo/font-load (major speedup on large multi-page files)
- Show loading overlay until all document fonts are loaded (no more partially rendered text)
- Load fonts when switching pages (previously only loaded for the first page)
- Always show visibility toggle on fill, stroke, and effect rows (matches Figma)
- Fix renderer crash on double destroy when closing files quickly
- Fix .fig page ordering — use deterministic byte comparison for fractional index positions
- Fix text truncation using `textTruncation` field instead of `textAutoResize`
- Fix horizontal scrollbar on design and pages panels
- Style scrollbars for Tauri (thin dark overlay instead of default OS chrome)
- Enable file watcher in Tauri — `watch` feature was missing from `tauri-plugin-fs`

- Fix pasted instances having no children — populate from component via symbolData when both are in clipboard
- Detect component sets on import — promote FRAME nodes with VARIANT componentPropDefs to COMPONENT_SET
- Skip internal canvas on paste — components on Figma's hidden internal page populate instances but are not pasted as visible nodes
- Apply instance overrides on paste — text content, fills, visibility, layoutGrow, and textAutoResize from symbolOverrides
- Fix auto-layout child ordering — sort by geometric position instead of z-order position strings
- Load fonts on paste and .fig import — collect font families from text nodes and load into CanvasKit
- Text measurement in auto-layout — use CanvasKit paragraph metrics for WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT text nodes
- Recompute layouts after font loading completes
- Fix PERCENT line height conversion — was stored as raw value instead of pixels
- Fix InvalidCharacterError when copying nodes with non-ASCII text
- Load all font weight/style variants needed by pasted text nodes
- Fix font loading not registering in core cache
- Fix halfLeading applied to text measurement — enable only for rendering
- Clear hover on zoom/pinch to keep scene picture cache valid
- Fix flip buttons using rotation math instead of actual mirroring
- Fix flip transform encoding — scale first matrix column only (was incorrectly producing 180° rotation)
- Decode flip state from .fig transform matrix on import

- Render page dividers — pages named with only dashes/asterisks/spaces show as horizontal lines
- Only show component labels for COMPONENT and COMPONENT_SET, not instances
- Replace all native `<select>` dropdowns with reka-ui `AppSelect` component
- Smoother trackpad pinch-to-zoom with `Math.exp` curve and deltaMode normalization
- Fix font picker dropdown truncating long font names

### Fixes

- Fix drop shadow rendering on top of fills — shadow now draws behind opaque content
- Fix effect property changes not recorded in undo/redo history
- Fix active tab text invisible against same-color background
- Fix clipboard "Outside int range" error — `pasteID` used unsigned int exceeding Kiwi's signed 32-bit field
- Error toasts are now sticky (don't auto-dismiss), with selectable text, copy button, and close button
- Truncate long node names in export button

### Performance

- Per-node SkPicture cache for effect rendering — unchanged shadow/blur nodes replay from cache on scene redraws
- Drop shadows use `MaskFilter` direct draw instead of `saveLayer` offscreen buffers
- Cached `ImageFilter`, `MaskFilter`, reusable effect paint — zero per-frame WASM allocations for effects
- Reuse GL context on panel resize — swap surface without recreating renderer, preserving all caches
- Per-frame absolute position cache — avoids repeated parent-chain walks during rendering
- Optimize zoom/pan smoothness with `shallowReactive`, `useRafFn`, and input coalescing

### Build

- Auto-populate GitHub Release notes from CHANGELOG.md via `ffurrer2/extract-release-notes@v2`
- Skip already-published npm versions on CI re-runs instead of failing
- Exclude non-app directories from Vite file watcher

### Internal

## [0.4.2] (2026-03-02)

### Fixes

- Fix Figma clipboard paste: skip non-visual node types (variables, widgets, stickies, connectors)
- Fix text not rendering after paste — `letterSpacing` from Figma is a `{value, units}` object, was passed as-is → `NaN` broke CanvasKit paragraph layout
- Fix undo/redo for Figma paste — no undo entry was recorded; redo duplicated `childIds`
- Center pasted Figma content in viewport instead of using original coordinates
- Compute auto-layouts after clipboard paste (same as .fig import and demo creation)

### Improvements

- Import additional properties from Figma clipboard: `layoutAlignSelf`, `clipsContent`, `fontWeight`, `italic`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeight`
