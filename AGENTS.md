# OpenPencil

Vue 3 + CanvasKit (Skia WASM) + Yoga WASM design editor. Tauri v2 desktop, also runs in browser.

**Roadmap:** `packages/docs/development/roadmap.md` tracks product direction, Figma compatibility gaps, and raw metadata coverage. This file keeps agent-facing architecture, conventions, and commands; detailed public docs live under `packages/docs/**`.

## Monorepo

Bun workspace packages:

- `packages/scene-graph` — `@open-pencil/scene-graph`: SceneGraph, node types, copy/snap/undo helpers, variables, instances, hit testing. Framework-agnostic.
- `packages/pen` — `@open-pencil/pen`: Pen/vector editing helpers shared by core/editor surfaces.
- `packages/kiwi` — `@open-pencil/kiwi`: pure Kiwi schema/runtime/protocol package. Owns low-level Figma Kiwi codec/container/parse helpers and stays SceneGraph-agnostic.
- `packages/fig` — `@open-pencil/fig`: publishable `.fig` package shell and low-level smoke/test boundary. Production SceneGraph `.fig` policy still lives mostly in core while this package grows.
- `packages/core` — `@open-pencil/core`: renderer, layout, editor core, Figma API, tools, clipboard, vector conversion, and app/CLI-facing document I/O. Depends on scene-graph/pen/kiwi but keeps browser DOM out of core.
- `packages/dom-css` — `@open-pencil/dom-css`: DOM/CSS projection layer for HTML/CSS/JSX/Tailwind compatibility. Owns DesignDOM types and browser/headless CSS runtime adapters; keeps DOM/CSS parser dependencies out of core.
- `packages/vue` — `@open-pencil/vue`: headless Vue 3 SDK (Reka UI-style) for building custom OpenPencil-powered editor shells and embedded editing surfaces. Renderless components and composables. The app is one consumer of the SDK.
- `packages/cli` — `@open-pencil/cli`: headless CLI for .fig inspection, export, linting. Uses `citty` + `agentfmt`.
- `packages/mcp` — `@open-pencil/mcp`: MCP server for AI coding tools. Stdio + HTTP (Hono). Reuses core tools.
- `packages/docs` — `@open-pencil/docs`: published VitePress documentation site. Run with `bun run docs:dev`.

The root app (`src/`) is the Tauri/Vite desktop editor. App-specific editor, document, AI, collaboration, shell, tabs, demo, and automation code lives under `src/app/*`. The app consumes scene graph primitives from `@open-pencil/scene-graph`, editor/rendering services through targeted `@open-pencil/core` subpath exports, and `@open-pencil/vue` through the public Vue SDK entrypoint.

### Public package exports

Use public package exports across package/app boundaries. Do not import workspace package internals from app code.

- `@open-pencil/scene-graph` — SceneGraph, node types, primitives, copy/snap/undo, instance helpers, variable helpers, vector-network types.
- `@open-pencil/core` — broad compatibility barrel for editor/rendering/tooling APIs.
- Common targeted core subpaths keep imports smaller and dependency intent clearer: `@open-pencil/core/color`, `/text`, `/vector`, `/figma-api`, `/icons`, `/canvas`, `/design-jsx`, `/editor`, `/tools`, `/kiwi`, `/clipboard`, `/rpc`, `/lint`, `/profiler`, `/io`, `/canvaskit`, `/layout`.
- Use `@open-pencil/kiwi` for low-level Kiwi/FIG schema-runtime, codec, container, GUID, and parse helpers.

CanvasKit runtime loading is centralized in `@open-pencil/core/canvaskit` for app/browser use. Headless raster export may dynamically load `canvaskit-wasm/full`; elsewhere prefer `import type` and pass the CanvasKit instance in.

### Editor architecture

`packages/core/src/editor/` is the framework-agnostic editor core. `createEditor()` in `create.ts` assembles an `EditorContext` plus domain action modules for viewport, selection, pages, shapes, structure, components, clipboard, undo/history, text, variables, layout, color space, graph reads, tool registry, and related helpers. Check the folder before adding editor behavior; keep new actions in the nearest domain module/folder instead of growing unrelated files.

`Editor` type = `ReturnType<typeof createEditor>`. Core modules should share state through `EditorContext` rather than importing app code or Vue.

#### Editor event bus

The editor exposes a typed nanoevents emitter. Event names/payloads live in `EditorEvents` in `packages/core/src/editor/types.ts`; graph events are bridged from SceneGraph by `graph-events.ts`. Subscribe with `editor.onEditorEvent(event, handler)`, or in Vue use `useEditorEvent(event, handler)` from `packages/vue/src/editor/events/use.ts`.

Important invariant: all selection mutations in core go through `ctx.setSelectedIds()` and all tool changes go through `ctx.setActiveTool()` so events fire consistently. App-layer code should use editor actions such as `clearSelection()`, `select()`, or `setTool()` — never direct `state.selectedIds =` or `state.activeTool =` assignments.

The app editor session (`src/app/editor/session/create.ts`) is a Vue wrapper around core: it creates reactive state, calls `createEditor()`, and assembles app-specific document I/O, autosave, export, vector edit, pen resume, flashes, profiler, and mobile clipboard. Tabs live in `src/app/tabs/`; active editor access lives in `src/app/editor/active-store/`.

## Commands

- `bun run check` — full package build, type-aware lint, typecheck, architecture checks, and repo tooling checks. Heavy; use in CI or an explicit full validation pass.
- `bun run check:arch` — Steiger architecture lint for project-specific import boundaries
- `bun run check:vue` — vue-tsc type-check for app and Vue SDK .vue files
- `bun run test:dupes` — jscpd copy-paste detection across product TS sources
- `bun run test:tools` — tests for private repo tooling under `tools/*`
- `bun run format` — oxfmt with import sorting
- `bun run test:unit` — full engine/unit test suite. Heavy; prefer targeted test files during local AI work.
- `bun run test` — Playwright E2E and visual regression tests. Starts a Vite web server and browser workers.
- `bun run tauri dev` — desktop app with hot reload
- `bun open-pencil --help` — list CLI commands. Common commands include `info`, `tree`, `find`, `node`, `pages`, `variables`, `export`, `convert`, `lint`, `query`, `selection`, `formats`, `analyze ...`, and `eval` for Figma Plugin API scripting.

### Local AI-agent safety

On this Windows checkout, local Codex/Claude Code sessions have previously triggered system-wide virtual memory exhaustion by launching broad Bun/Node validation commands. AI agents must treat the following commands as opt-in only unless the user explicitly asks for a full validation or release build:

- `bun run check`
- `bun run build` / `bun run build:packages`
- `bun run test:unit` / `bun test ./tests/engine`
- `bun run test`, Playwright snapshot updates, or broad `bunx playwright test`
- `bun run tauri dev`, `bun run tauri build`, or `tauri build`

Default local validation should be narrow and bounded:

- Run the smallest relevant `bun test path/to/file.test.ts` or `bun test path/to/domain/` target for touched code.
- Run focused checks such as `bun run check:packages`, `bun run check:arch`, or `bun run check:vue` only when the touched area needs them.
- Use hard timeouts for every Bun/Node/Playwright command. Do not leave background tasks running after a timeout.
- If a command is backgrounded, times out, or produces an empty long-running task output, stop launching more Node/Bun work, inspect the process list, and report the blocked validation.
- Before any explicit full validation, first check for stray `node.exe`, `bun.exe`, `chrome-headless-shell.exe`, Vite, and MCP processes. Run one heavy gate at a time and stop immediately if memory pressure grows.
- When a browser preview is necessary, prefer an existing server. If starting a dev server, record the PID/port and stop it before finishing.

Final status from an AI session must distinguish targeted validation that ran from full gates skipped for local resource safety.

## Releases & CI

### How to release

1. Update version in the root `package.json`, publishable `packages/*/package.json`, `desktop/tauri.conf.json`, and `desktop/Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` — move "Unreleased" items under new version heading with date
3. Commit: `Release v0.x.y`
4. Tag: `git tag v0.x.y && git push --tags`
5. Ensure GitHub release secrets include `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` if the updater key is password-protected); the public updater key is configured in `desktop/tauri.conf.json`.
6. The `build.yml` workflow triggers on `v*` tags and:
   - Builds Tauri binaries for macOS (arm64 + x64), Windows (x64 + arm64), Linux (x64)
   - Creates a draft GitHub Release with all platform binaries
   - Publishes public workspace packages to npm with provenance. Keep the exact package list in sync with `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
7. The production web app/docs deploy workflows (`app.yml`, `docs.yml`) also trigger on `v*` tags. They do **not** deploy on ordinary `master` pushes.
8. Go to GitHub Releases → edit the draft → paste changelog section → publish

### CI workflows

Key workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. Use `build.yml` as the source of truth for release packaging and npm publishing, `ci.yml` / `heavy-tests.yml` for validation gates, and `app.yml` / `docs.yml` for Cloudflare Pages deploys.

### Before committing

Human maintainers and CI should run all quality gates (see [Code quality](#code-quality) for the self-review checklist):

```sh
bun run check          # oxlint + tsgo type-aware lint & typecheck
bun run format         # oxfmt
bun run test:dupes     # jscpd — zero clones
bun run test:tools     # private repo tooling tests
bun run test:unit      # bun:test
cd packages/dom-css && bun run check  # standalone DOM/CSS package checks
bun run test           # Playwright E2E
```

Production Cloudflare Pages deploys are intentionally release/manual only: `app.yml` and `docs.yml` run on `v*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`, not on `master` pushes. To deploy manually, run the relevant workflow from GitHub Actions (`Deploy app` or `Deploy docs`) on the desired ref; the workflow deploys to the configured production branch (`master`).

Local AI agents must follow [Local AI-agent safety](#local-ai-agent-safety) instead of automatically running the full gate set. Report any skipped full gates explicitly.

## Documentation

- `CHANGELOG.md` — all user-facing changes, grouped by version. "Unreleased" section at top for in-progress work.
- `README.md` — user-facing: features, getting started, CLI, project structure. No implementation details.
- `AGENTS.md` (this file) — contributor/agent reference: architecture, conventions, how to release.
- `packages/docs/` — VitePress site deployed at `openpencil.dev`. User guide, SDK, automation, reference, and development docs.

When adding features, update `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased section) and `README.md` (if user-facing). Update `AGENTS.md` when architecture or conventions change. Do not put speculative/internal implementation plans in `packages/docs/**`; VitePress docs are published. Keep temporary plans in ignored `scratch/` or distill durable public direction into the canonical roadmap.

## Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits for regular development commits: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.

- Keep the first line short, imperative, and scoped when helpful
- Put rationale and implementation details in the commit body
- Keep the commit type lowercase (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`), but start each body line/bullet with an uppercase word
- Preserve product/domain casing in subjects and bodies: `DOM/CSS`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `JSX`, `Tailwind`, `Kiwi`, `.fig`, `MCP`, `CLI`, `AI`, `ACP`, `i18n`. Do not flatten acronyms to lowercase prose such as `dom css documents`.
- Prefer scopes that match the project structure: `app`, `tauri`, `core`, `cli`, `dom-css`, `mcp`, `vue`, `docs`, or focused domains like `editor`, `scene-graph`, `canvas`, `tools`, `kiwi`, `io`, `text`, `vector`, `color`, `acp`, `ai`, `collab`, `automation`, `i18n`
- Use the narrowest honest scope, or omit it if the change spans multiple unrelated areas

Example:

```text
fix(editor): preserve text edit undo state

- Snapshot both text and styleRuns when editing starts
- Restore both on undo instead of comparing against the live node
```

Release commits are the exception: keep using `Release v0.x.y`.

## CLI

- All CLI output must use `agentfmt` formatters — `fmtList`, `fmtHistogram`, `fmtSummary`, `fmtNode`, `fmtTree`, `kv`, `entity`, `bold`, `dim`, etc.
- Don't hand-roll `console.log` formatting — use the helpers from `packages/cli/src/format.ts` which re-exports agentfmt with project-specific adapters (`nodeToData`, `nodeDetails`, `nodeToTreeNode`, `nodeToListItem`)
- CLI data/inspection commands should support `--json` for machine-readable output

## Tools (AI / MCP / CLI)

- Framework-agnostic tool operations live under `packages/core/src/tools/**` as `ToolDef` objects. Domains include read, create, modify, structure, variables, vector, analyze, describe, codegen, stock-photo, and helpers. Check the existing domain folder before adding a new file.
- `schema.ts` defines `ToolDef`, `defineTool()`, and shared result helpers. Each tool has a name, description, typed params, and an `execute(figma: FigmaAPI, args)` function.
- Registries (`registry*.ts`) assemble tool sets. Add new tools to the appropriate registry so AI chat, MCP, and CLI eval paths can see them.
- AI adapter (`packages/core/src/tools/ai-adapter.ts`) converts ToolDefs to Vercel AI tools with valibot schemas. `src/app/ai/tools/index.ts` is a thin app wire that creates `FigmaAPI` from the active editor.
- CLI commands in `packages/cli/src/commands/**` are not generated from ToolDefs; they own CLI UX, pagination, and agentfmt formatting. The `eval` command exposes ToolDef operations through `FigmaAPI`.
- MCP server code lives in `packages/mcp/src/server.ts`. MCP-only tools such as `open_file`, `new_document`, `save_file`, and `get_codegen_prompt` are registered there because they need server filesystem access or are not scene-graph tools.
- `open_file` and `new_document` are only registered when `OPENPENCIL_MCP_ROOT` is set. Export tools can write files under that root when given a `path`.
- Core codegen prompts live as markdown under `packages/core/src/tools/prompts/`; app chat/ACP prompts live under `src/app/ai/**` markdown files.
- `FigmaAPI` (`packages/core/src/figma-api/`) is the execution target for tools and CLI eval. It is Figma Plugin API compatible and uses Symbols for hidden internals.

## ACP and collaboration

Keep this section light; implementation details move often.

- ACP UI/transport lives under `src/app/ai/acp/**`; provider definitions live in `packages/core/src/constants.ts`; app prompts live under `src/app/ai/**`. Public docs: `packages/docs/programmable/ai-chat.md` and `packages/docs/programmable/mcp-server.md`.
- ACP transport uses Tauri shell permissions, so check `desktop/capabilities/**` when changing agent launch behavior.
- Collaboration lives under `src/app/collab/**` and is documented in `packages/docs/programmable/collaboration.md`. It uses Trystero + Yjs + awareness; preserve crypto-safe room IDs and peer cleanup semantics when changing it.

## Code conventions

- Do not place code or tests ad hoc. Before adding or moving files, inspect the existing folder structure and nearby patterns, then put changes in the established domain-specific location. If no proper location exists, create one deliberately and update docs/conventions as needed.
- Architecture boundaries are enforced by `bun run check:arch` and related lint rules; keep app/package boundaries clean instead of relying on review to catch private imports. In practice: use public workspace exports across boundaries, keep core framework-agnostic, keep app services separate from component/view layers, keep shared UI free of app stores/services, and keep property-panel internals inside the property panel.
- Test placement is strict: app E2E in `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts`, Figma automation in `tests/figma/**/*.spec.ts`, engine/unit tests in `tests/engine/**/*.test.ts`, shared test utilities in `tests/helpers/**`, and standalone package tests in their package `tests/**` when established. UI-visible behavior belongs in E2E; graph/internal-state assertions belong in engine/unit tests. Do not commit temporary/profile specs.

### File and folder naming

OpenPencil uses domain namespaces rather than full Feature-Sliced Design ceremony:

- App services/state/integration live under `src/app/**`; route/layout views live under `src/views/**`; app UI lives under `src/components/**`.
- `src/components/ui/**` is the shared app design-system layer. `packages/vue/src/primitives/**` is the headless SDK primitive layer. App wrappers around SDK primitives should stay in app component domains and only move to `ui/**` when genuinely generic.
- Root-level `src/components/*.vue` is reserved for broad editor panels/surfaces assembled by views or shell layout. Do not add new root-level base controls; create a domain namespace or use `src/components/ui/**` for reusable primitives.
- App component domain folders should be lowercase or kebab-case (`chat/`, `properties/`, `fill-picker/`, `color-picker-panel/`, `canvas/`, `inputs/`). Avoid adding new `PascalCase/Component.vue` app folders; migrate existing ones gradually when touched.
- Vue component files stay PascalCase: `ColorPickerRoot.vue`, `ToolbarItem.vue`. Component-scoped composables use camelCase: `useToolbarState.ts`, `usePageList.ts`.
- Non-component domain folders use lowercase or kebab-case: `scene-graph/`, `figma-api/`, `node-edit/`. Non-component TypeScript files use lowercase or kebab-case unless they are conventional entrypoints such as `index.ts`, `types.ts`, `context.ts`, or `use.ts`.
- Multi-file root components live inside their component namespace folder, not beside it. When a reusable picker/input/control grows beyond one file, create a namespace instead of leaving related files at `src/components/` root.
- Use subfolders for multi-file domains instead of sibling files with repeated prefixes. Prefer `selection/container.ts`, `selection/hit-test.ts` over `selection-container.ts`, `selection-hit-test.ts`. When adding a second file for a domain (e.g. `eval-wrap.ts` next to `eval.ts`), create the folder immediately (`eval/index.ts` + `eval/wrap.ts`) instead of prefixing. Oxlint catches sibling prefix files when a sibling folder exists; Steiger catches 3+ sibling files with the same prefix. The convention applies even before either rule triggers.

### Repo tools and scripts

Private repository tooling lives under `tools/<domain>/`, not as ad-hoc root scripts. Use kebab-case domain folders and split by capability inside `src/`:

```text
tools/<domain>/
  package.json
  src/index.ts
  src/<capability>.ts
  tests/<capability>.test.ts
```

Use `scripts/` only for tiny compatibility entrypoint shims that import `../tools/<domain>/src/...`; do not put implementation logic there. Workflow helpers, release packaging helpers, architecture rules, package checks, visual-oracle utilities, and other maintainable programs belong in `tools/` with focused tests when they contain logic. Steiger enforces tool layout and script shims. `bun run check` includes `bun run test:tools`, and lint/format cover `tools/`.

- `@/` import alias for app cross-directory imports; app feature code lives under `src/app/*`
- Use package-local aliases inside workspace packages: `#vue/*` in `packages/vue`, `#cli/*` in `packages/cli`, `#dom-css/*` in `packages/dom-css`, `#mcp/*` in `packages/mcp`, and `#core/*` when core code needs an alias. Prefer relative imports within nearby core modules when that is clearer than an alias.
- No `any` — use proper types, generics, declaration merging
- No `!` non-null assertions — use guards, `?.`, `??`
- No `Math.random()` — use `crypto.getRandomValues()` everywhere
- No inline type definitions when a named type exists — use `Color` not `{ r: number; g: number; b: number; a: number }`, use `Vector` not `{ x: number; y: number }`, and import `SceneNode` / `Effect` / `Fill` / `Stroke` from `@open-pencil/scene-graph` instead of re-spelling their shapes.
- Shared geometry/color primitives live in `packages/scene-graph/src/primitives.ts`; scene/node domain types live in `packages/scene-graph/src/types.ts` and are exported from `@open-pencil/scene-graph`.
- Window API extensions (showOpenFilePicker, queryLocalFonts) live in `src/global.d.ts` and `packages/core/src/global.d.ts`
- Use `culori` for color conversions — don't reimplement parseColor/colorToRgba
- Use `@vueuse/core` hooks — prefer higher-level composables (`useBreakpoints`, `useEventListener`, `onClickOutside`, etc.) over raw APIs (`useMediaQuery`, manual `addEventListener`)
- Prefer VueUse utilities for simple browser/timer state: `refAutoReset` for temporary copied/saved flags, `promiseTimeout` for async sleeps/retry backoff, `useClipboard`/`useFileDialog`/`useLocalStorage` where they fit the local state model. Don't force VueUse when direct APIs are clearer: one-shot `requestAnimationFrame` focus/defer calls, explicit service-owned reconnect/permission timers, or nanostores-backed state can stay hand-rolled.
- No module-level mutable state in components — use the editor store
- Prefer `tw-animate-css` for animations — don't hand-write `<style>` transition keyframes
- No duplicated component logic — if two components share data (icon maps, util functions, constants), export from one place and import in both
- `packages/kiwi/src/schema-runtime/` contains the Kiwi codec runtime; keep runtime changes minimal and prefer wrappers/helpers for project-specific validation
- Core code must guard browser APIs with explicit runtime checks such as `typeof window !== 'undefined'` / `typeof document !== 'undefined'` before using them.
- Name repeated or cross-feature constants; use `src/constants.ts` for app-wide constants rather than feature-local values.

## Code quality

Before submitting a PR, human maintainers and CI should run the full quality gate and do a self-review:

```sh
bun run check          # oxlint + tsgo type-aware lint & typecheck — zero errors required
bun run format         # oxfmt with import sorting
bun run test:dupes     # jscpd — zero clones required
bun run test:tools     # private repo tooling tests
bun run test:unit      # bun:test
bun run test           # Playwright E2E
```

For local AI sessions, do not run the full quality gate by default. Use targeted tests and focused checks for the touched files, then state which full gates remain unrun because of the Windows resource-exhaustion risk.

Self-review checklist:

- Run `bun run test:dupes` — if duplication rises, extract shared helpers or use existing types
- No inline type definitions that duplicate named types (Color, Vector, SceneNode, Effect, Fill, Stroke, etc.)
- No copy-pasted logic — extract into functions. If two components share a util, icon map, or data structure, export from one place. If `jscpd` flags it, fix it.
- Use precise union types — `'closed' | 'half' | 'full'` not `number | string | null`
- Files should stay under ~600 lines — split by domain when they grow (see `packages/core/src/tools/` for the pattern)
- `structuredClone` for deep copies, never shallow spread when mutating nested objects
- Don't hand-roll what a dependency already does. Check existing deps first (`package.json`, `packages/*/package.json`). If none covers it, find a quality library instead of inlining an implementation — e.g. use `diff` for unified diffs, not a custom line-by-line loop; use `culori` for color math, not manual RGB parsing.
- Before custom UI/control/composable work, read upstream docs for the relevant dependency instead of guessing from local usage. Prefer their `llms.txt` entrypoints when available:
  - Reka UI (`https://reka-ui.com/llms.txt`) before building dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, menus, selects, tooltips, toasts, trees, splitters, or other primitives.
  - VueUse (`https://vueuse.org/llms.txt`) before hand-rolling DOM events, browser APIs, refs/focus, media queries, timers, clipboard, storage, async state, or observers.
  - Tailwind / tailwind-variants docs before inventing one-off styling prop APIs or variant composition.
- If upstream docs contradict local patterns, prefer current upstream APIs and update local wrappers deliberately.
- `es-toolkit` is available in core for small, focused utility helpers when it clearly improves readability. Prefer subpath imports such as `es-toolkit/object`, `es-toolkit/array`, and `es-toolkit/predicate`; good fits include `omit` / `pick` for object key selection, `uniq` for dedupe, and `isNotNil` for typed nullish filtering. Do not replace clear native JavaScript just for consistency, and avoid `es-toolkit/compat` unless deliberately migrating lodash-compatible behavior.

## Rendering

- Canvas is CanvasKit (Skia WASM) on a WebGL surface, not DOM
- `renderVersion` vs `sceneVersion`: `renderVersion` = canvas repaint (pan/zoom/hover); `sceneVersion` = scene graph mutations. UI that only cares about graph data should avoid watching repaint-only state; use editor events for incremental surfaces such as the layer tree.
- `requestRender()` bumps both counters; `requestRepaint()` bumps only `renderVersion`
- `renderNow()` is only for surface recreation and font loading (need immediate draw)
- Resize observer uses rAF throttle, not debounce — debounce causes canvas skew
- Viewport culling skips off-screen nodes; unclipped parents are NOT culled (children may extend beyond bounds)
- Selection border width must be constant regardless of zoom — divide by scale
- Section/frame title text never scales — render at fixed font size, ellipsize to fit
- Rulers are rendered on the canvas (not DOM), with selection range badges that don't overlap tick numbers
- Remote cursors: Figma-style colored arrows with white border + name pill, rendered in screen space
- Pixel-affecting renderer features need committed visual coverage, not just mock/geometry assertions. Add or update a Playwright canvas snapshot for changes to fills, gradients, images, blend modes, masks, boolean geometry, corners, strokes, shadows, blur, text rendering, or demo showcase scenes. Use targeted snapshot updates such as `bunx playwright test tests/e2e/canvas/renderer-visuals.spec.ts --project=openpencil --update-snapshots` and then rerun the same test without `--update-snapshots`.
- Never draw CJK/Arabic text via the default `r.textFont` typeface (Inter has no CJK glyphs and would render as tofu). When `r.fontsLoaded` is false or the script fallback is missing, `renderText` must skip the text and either stay silent or draw a soft placeholder rectangle. The render loop must gate on `r.fontsLoaded` (with a timeout escape hatch) and `openFileInNewTab` / `openFigFile` must call `ensureGraphFonts` so the document's text fonts are loaded before the first post-open render.

## Scene graph

- Nodes live in flat `Map<string, SceneNode>`, tree via `parentIndex` references
- Frames clip content by default is OFF (unlike what you'd assume)
- When creating auto-layout, sort children by geometric position first
- Dragging a child outside a frame should reparent it, not clip it
- Layer panel tree must react to reparenting — watch for stale children refs
- Groups: creating a group must preserve children's visual positions

## Components & instances

- Purple (#9747ff) for COMPONENT, COMPONENT_SET, INSTANCE — matches Figma
- Instance children map to component children via `componentId` for 1:1 sync
- Override key format: `"childId:propName"` in instance's `overrides` record
- Editing a component must propagate to instances through the editor/component sync path; do not hand-copy instance fields in app UI code.
- Instance property copying lives in `@open-pencil/scene-graph` helpers and uses structured copies for nested values.

## Layout

- `computeAllLayouts()` must be called after demo creation and after opening .fig files
- Yoga WASM handles flexbox; CSS Grid blocked on upstream (facebook/yoga#1893)
- Auto-layout creation (Shift+A) must recompute layout immediately to update selection bounds

## UI

### Component structure

- `src/components/ui/**` is the app design-system layer: reusable visual primitives, wrappers around Reka UI primitives, low-level styled controls, and UI class helpers. These files must not import app services/stores or feature panels.
- `src/components/Shell/**` is for app shell chrome and global app services rendered as components (menu bar, toast viewport, update/status chrome). Shell components may use app shell/editor stores.
- `src/components/properties/**`, `src/components/chat/**`, `src/components/LayerTree/**`, `src/components/Toolbar/**`, and similar folders are feature/domain component namespaces. Keep feature-specific controls there unless they are genuinely reusable UI primitives.
- Treat existing root-level picker/input/control components as migration candidates when touched; do not expand that pattern.
- Test hooks should be `data-test-id` attributes owned by the rendered markup or generated internally from semantic component state. Do not add `testId`, `visibilityTestId`, `triggerTestId`, or other test-id props to component APIs.

- Use reka-ui for UI components (Splitter, ContextMenu, DropdownMenu, etc.)
- Vue UI styling APIs must follow the existing `:ui` / `tailwind-variants` slot pattern. Do not add one-off `fooClass`, `barClass`, `emptyActionClass`, etc. props to components; define a typed `Ui` object with named slots and merge through the local `use*UI()` helper or a `ui` prop.
- Do not pass imperative setters/actions through slots as `:set-*`, `:update-*`, `:request-*`, `:toggle-*`, etc. unless the component is explicitly a renderless primitive whose whole contract is slot actions. Prefer `v-model`, emitted events, normal component props, or owned default UI. For DOM refs/focus, use VueUse (`templateRef`, `unrefElement`, `useFocus`, etc.) instead of ref callback plumbing through slots.
- App wrappers around SDK primitives should compose a single `ui` object from shared UI helpers (`useSelectUI`, `usePopoverUI`, etc.) rather than bypassing the design system with raw Tailwind strings spread across multiple props.
- Editor commands share `packages/vue/src/editor/commands/registry.ts` as the canonical source for shortcut display tokens, keyboard bindings, and context-menu test IDs. Store portable shortcuts such as `MOD+D`, `MOD+SHIFT+H`, and `MOD+ALT+K`; format them with `formatShortcut()` at render time so macOS shows `⌘`/`⌥` and Windows/Linux show `Ctrl`/`Alt`.
- Labels and translations must not contain shortcut text. Keep labels semantic (`Add auto layout`, `Show/Hide`) and render shortcuts from command metadata. Steiger enforces this for `packages/vue/src/i18n/messages.ts` and locale JSON files.
- Canvas context-menu structure lives in `packages/vue/src/editor/menu-model/canvas.ts`. Do not hand-build command grouping in `src/components/canvas/CanvasMenu.vue`; the component should render menu entries and provide app-specific actions only when unavoidable.
- Browser and Tauri menus share `src/app/shell/menu/schema.ts` as the canonical menu model. Do not add menu items directly in `src/components/Shell/AppMenu.vue` or `desktop/src/menu.rs`.
- Regenerate the native menu with `bun run generate:tauri-menu` after editing the shared menu schema; `desktop/generated/menu.json` is consumed by the Tauri menu builder. Tauri also runs this generator from `desktop/tauri.conf.json` via `beforeDevCommand` and `beforeBuildCommand`.
- Every shared menu item with an `id` must be handled by `src/app/shell/menu/use.ts`, an editor command, or explicitly marked browser/native-only in the schema.
- Tailwind 4 for styling — no inline CSS, no component-level `<style>` blocks
- Use `Tip` / tooltip components for hover help; do not add native `title` attributes in Vue UI.
- Mac keyboards: use `e.code` not `e.key` for shortcuts with modifiers (Option transforms characters)
- Icons: use unplugin-icons with Iconify/Lucide (`<icon-lucide-*>`) — don't use raw SVG or Unicode symbols
- App menu (`src/components/Shell/AppMenu.vue`) — browser-only menu bar using reka-ui Menubar components; Tauri uses native menus, so menu is hidden when `IS_TAURI` is true
- Preserve established UI gotchas in nearby components before refactoring: splitter handle sizing, ScrubInput pointer ownership, section drag targets, side-panel containment, and global number-spinner styling.

## File format

- `.fig` files use Figma's Kiwi schema and `NodeChange[]` records. Low-level schema/runtime/codec/container/parse helpers live in `packages/kiwi/src/fig/**` and `packages/kiwi/src/schema-runtime/**`.
- Core still owns SceneGraph `.fig` policy: import/export orchestration in `packages/core/src/io/formats/fig/**`, SceneGraph ⇄ NodeChange conversion in `packages/core/src/kiwi/fig/node-change/**`, and component/instance override interpretation in `packages/core/src/kiwi/fig/instance-overrides/**`.
- `packages/fig` is the publishable boundary for future `.fig` policy extraction; do not move behavior there without package-local tests and dist smoke.
- Vector data uses reverse-engineered `vectorNetworkBlob` binary format — encoder/decoder in `packages/core/src/vector/` and scene-graph vector-network types in `@open-pencil/scene-graph`.
- `showOpenFilePicker` / `showSaveFilePicker` are File System Access API (Chrome/Edge), not Tauri-only; code must keep browser fallbacks.
- Safari save: no File System Access API → use an `<a>` download fallback with deferred `revokeObjectURL`. SafariBanner warns users about limitations.
- Tauri detection: use `IS_TAURI` from `@open-pencil/core/constants` / `src/constants.ts`; don't inline `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` checks.
- `.fig` export compression uses fflate in browser paths and Tauri Rust commands where available.
- Test `.fig` round-trip by exporting and reimporting in Figma when changing file-format behavior.
- Test fixtures (`tests/fixtures/*.fig`) are Git LFS. If no `.fig` fixtures changed, `git push --no-verify` can skip the slow LFS pre-push hook; use regular `git push` when fixtures changed.

## Tauri

- Tauri v2 desktop app lives under `desktop/`; check `desktop/Cargo.toml`, `desktop/capabilities/**`, and `desktop/tauri.conf.json` before adding desktop capabilities.
- File system and shell permissions must be configured explicitly; vague "Internal error" save failures often mean missing permissions.
- Dev tools: add or use a menu item to toggle, don't rely on keyboard shortcuts.

## Publishing

- `bun publish` from package dirs — resolves `workspace:*` → actual versions
- Public packages publish built `dist/` output, not runtime TypeScript entrypoints
- Public workspace packages build before publishing; most use tsdown, and split packages may also run `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` plus dist smoke checks. Keep release tooling package lists in sync with `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- CLI publishes a Node-compatible `bin/openpencil.js` wrapper; do not point package `bin` entries at TypeScript source
